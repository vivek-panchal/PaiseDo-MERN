## Configuration and Setup
In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as zip and unzip on your machine. 
- Open the project in your prefered code editor.
- Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
- Split your terminal into two (run the client on one terminal and the server on the other terminal)

In the first terminal
```
$ cd client
$ npm install (to install client-side dependencies)
$ npm start (to start the client)
```

For setting up backend
- cd create a .env file in the root of your directory.
- Supply the following credentials

```
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=

```

Please follow [This tutorial](https://dev.to/dalalrohit/how-to-connect-to-mongodb-atlas-using-node-js-k9i) to create your mongoDB connection url, which you'll use as your MONGODB_URI

Provide some random key in ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET or you could generate one using node enter the below command in the terminal to genrate a random secret key 

```
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(256).toString('base64'));"
```

In the second terminal (*in the project root directory (back-end))

```
$ npm install (to install server-side dependencies)
& npm start (to start the server)
```
